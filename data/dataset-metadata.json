  "description": "### Context\n\nThis wants to be nothing more than a collection of all 1 minute candlesticks on Binance. Not all trading pairs are included yet. I am working on fully automating both gathering and uploading the data---see [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/gosuto-ai/candlestick_scraper).\n\n### Content\n\nFor every trading pair all fields as returned by [Binance's official API endpoint for historical candlestick data](https://github.com/binance-exchange/binance-official-api-docs/blob/master/rest-api.md#klinecandlestick-data) are saved into their own csv file. First entry is the first timestamp available on the exchange, which is around 2017 for the longest running pairs.\n\nThe [Getting Started kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/jorijnsmit/getting-started-with-binance-s-candlesticks/) has a quick function that adds the right label to each column and converts it to its correct data type.\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F2234678%2F37312fed3446efa449b5a6d5a1b8595a%2F__results___9_1.png?generation=1581781161085470&alt=media)\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nOne obvious use-case for this data could be general analysis such as adding indicators (moving averages, MACD, RSI, etc.) or creating correlation matrices. Other approaches could include backtesting trading algorithms or computing arbitrage potential with other exchanges.",
